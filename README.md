# dice-roller-rs
CLI program written in Rust to similuate rolling dice.

# Usage
Currently the program is to be ran inside a terminal without arguments. Program prompts for a dice input. Input should be in the form of XdY or XDY where X is the number of dice to roll and Y is the number of sides on those dice (for example, 3d6 will roll 3 6-sided dice).

# Known Bugs
There is currently little error handling and the program is very prone to panicing if not used correctly. In time I might clean up these bugs as further language practice.

This repo is not open to contributions of any kind. It purely exists as a project for me to tinker with Rust concepts. This project has no promise of functionality or reliability. Users are free to clone and fork for their own use and learning, but should do so at their own risk.
